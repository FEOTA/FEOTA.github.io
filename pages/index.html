          <h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Which countries do you cover in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; At present, we cover Finland, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Switzerland only.</p>
<p><strong>Is FEOTA a legitimate consulting service?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; Yes, FEOTA Oy (business ID 3225816-1) is a company registered in the Finnish trade register (Kaupparekisteri).</p>
<p><strong>Where is FEOTA&rsquo;s office located?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; Our main office is located at Kirkkonummi, capital region of Finland. We do not have any other branches or business affiliates or business partners anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p><strong>How do I book for an appointment with a consultant?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; First fill up the <a href="/register/">registration form</a> and then pick one of the consulting services from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. Once the registration is done, our representative will connect you with a consultant.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any additional or hidden costs on top of the service fees mentioned on the price list?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; There are no hidden costs. The service fees mentioned on the price chart do not include VAT. A 24% VAT will be added on top of each package/service fee while calculating the total and this is clearly declared in our price charts.</p>
<p><strong>How do I pay for the services?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; You can buy our services from our online store and make the payment there. If none of the payment options suit you, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> directly and we will find an alternative payment option.</p>
<p><strong>Can I talk directly with a consultant before registration?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; Unfortunately, there is no free trial option available for unregistered clients.</p>
<p><strong>If I pay extra, can you get me admitted to an European university?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; FEOTA&rsquo;s key principles are: honesty, transparency, reliability and affordability. We do not accept extra payment outside our price chart published on this website and we are committed to maintain our integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Is IELTS required to apply in the Finnish universities?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; Yes, Finnish universities require an overall band score of 6.5 for IELTS. All of them accept <strong>IELTS Academic</strong> test while some universities also accept <strong>IELTS Indicator</strong> test. However, IELTS General test is not accepted for university level studies.</p>
<p><strong>How much is the application fee to Finnish universities?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; There is no application fee to the Finnish universities. However, for non-EU students, there is an annual tuition fee and student union fee which differs from one university to the other.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to know Finnish language to obtain a student visa in Finland?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; No, Finnish is not a must to apply for a student visa (B-permit) in Finland. Your studies in Finnish universities can be completed entirely in English.</p>
<p><strong>Am I guaranteed an admission to a Finnish university if I buy FEOTA&rsquo;s consulting service?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; Top Finnish universities are very selective and accept only few applicants every year who demonstrate strong motivation and have sufficient educational background to be able to complete the selected degree programmes. Some degree programmes are harder to get into compared to others and it is completely upto the university admission services to make the final decision. FEOTA does not in any way involve or interfere with university&rsquo;s selection process. Instead, we aim to help you prepare to the best of your abilities so that your chance of admittance will be higher.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to get Finnish citizenship while studying in Finland?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; To obtain a Finnish citizenship, one must have sufficient Finnish language skills, means of support, clean criminal record, and sufficient period of residence in Finland. The student visa or B permit is considered a temporary permit and is not enough to fulfil the requirement of sufficient period of residency condition. This means you must have a continuous residence permit for a certain period before you are eligibe to apply for Finnish citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need IELTS/TOEFL score to get admitted into Danish universities although I am currently studying in an english degree programme?</strong></p>
<p>&ndash; If you are studying in a country where English is not the first language, then you have to prove your English language proficiency level by taking one of the standardized tests such as IELTS/TOEFL/Cambridge ESOL examinations (CAE).</p>
